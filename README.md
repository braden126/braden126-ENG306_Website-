<p><strong>Why R for Data Analysis </strong></p>
<p>Data analysis is the process of cleaning, modeling, and visualizing data to find useful information. The R programming language is designed for data analysis and has many benefits when used:</p>
<ul>
<li>R is open source and free</li>
<li>R has an active online community for questions and advice</li>
<li>R has packages that are created by the R community and contain thousands of specifically designed functions</li>
<li>R uses the RStudio programming environment which supports publishing code online, downloading packages, error correction, and is highly customizable.</li>
</ul>
<p>R and Python are the two main programming languages used for data analysis. Both languages are effective for data analysis and worth learning. Python is more commonly used and is easier to learn because it is used for general programming along with data analysis. This guide focuses on R because it is specifically designed to perform data analysis which means R has more tools to perform statistical functions. RStudio is also easier to use when managing code and datasets than other Python programming environments like PyCharm.</p>
<p>This guide is intended for those interested in learning data analysis that already have an entry level knowledge of at least one programming language and statistics.</p>
<p><strong>RStudio</strong></p>
<p>RStudio is a free, integrated development environment made specifically for R. The layout of RStudio has four panels, the top left panel is for scripts, the top right panel is the global environment, the bottom left panel is the R console, and the bottom right panel is the file panel of the open project.</p>
<p>RStudio is also available online with RStudio Cloud. RStudio Cloud functions exactly like regular RStudio but can be accessed by any web browser after creating an account.</p>
<p>After opening RStudio, a new project can be created by selecting <strong>File</strong>, and then <strong>New Project</strong>. Then select <strong>New Directory</strong>, and then <strong>New Project</strong>. Next, name the project and select <strong>Create Project</strong>. When a new RStudio project is created, it will create a new folder for the project where all the newly created files are stored. Data files can be added to a project by placing them in the project folder.</p>
<p>Here is the view of a newly created RStudio project.</p>
